&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to speak about a problem that I have and that’s that I’m a philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say, “I’m a professor,” their eyes glaze over. When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I’m in and I say, “philosophy” — their eyes glaze over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I go to a philosopher’s party and they ask me what I work on and I say, “consciousness,” their eyes don’t glaze over — their lips curl into a snarl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
