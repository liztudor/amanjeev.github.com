She was born in a relatively upper-middle class family back in 1958. It is best to mention right now, that on the surface she does not seem like a victim of gender abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was old enough to know what &lt;em&gt;birthday&lt;/em&gt; meant, I was as excited as any other kid. I got gifts, presents and kudos for just being born on that day, though only by chance. At that time, it was important to just get as many &lt;em&gt;presents&lt;/em&gt; as I could while it's still &lt;em&gt;my day&lt;/em&gt;. After all, it would take a year for it to be today. One day, when I was young enough to not question the involvement of chance in my birth, I asked my mother about her birthday. Needless to say, I was shocked to learn that she had no idea about her actual date of birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;I was the second girl child in the family, so they wept and mourned when I was born, and no one cared to remember the date. When they had to get my birth certificate for school, they scribbled a random date which became my date of birth.&amp;quot;, she replied.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that was India more than 60 years ago. A country where you can still forge a driver's license easily, to get anything on your birth certificate would have been extremely easy in that era. Moreover, a lot of deliveries at that time were conducted through midwives at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the spectrum of emotions I feel when I think about that statement. I used to think that everyone has as loving, supportive and motivating parents as I have, despite their gender. How can anyone's parents forget their child's birthday?! It changed my world, completely. It was the first time I started observing how a male child in India can take everything for granted, started witnessing the extreme patriarchal setup. For example, it was, and still is assumed that the woman will change her last name after marriage; often, first names are also changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She spoke to a lot of elders (mostly aunts) in the family who were around the time of her birth. She heard the following pointers from her aunts -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You were probably born on a Tuesday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You were born during the monsoon season or it was raining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were the second female child so no one remembers because everyone was mourning your birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not end there. Like almost every person during that time, she had to get married to someone her parents chose. The argument in favor of arranged marriage that I have been told again and again is that parents know better about their children than the children themselves. In my mother's case, her father promised her to my father &lt;em&gt;without even meeting him or anyone from his family&lt;/em&gt;. I do not even want to begin mentioning how my mother's in-laws treated her the rest of her life but I blame that mainly on her own parents. It is hard for others to appreciate your kids when you don't appear to be caring about them youself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was a brilliant student and studied almost her entire student life on scholarships. She was the university topper in her subject - History - which was not her first choice. Her first passion was Biology and she wanted to study medical science. Obviously, she had to pass being a doctor because her father told her that one her brothers will be a doctor. He was given preference because, obviously, he's a boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother's parents are not alone in this grotesque treatment and this is not the worse story. For a country that boasts a plethora of goddesses in its culture, stories like my mom's throw light on this hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this about India is just a regular web search away but I wanted to write this little part of my mother's life story because it is her birthday this week. I salute her for being so brave at every step of her life, starting from the first day of her birth.&lt;/p&gt;
