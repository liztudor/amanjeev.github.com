I will not name this certain someone but just know that he is apparently a talented FOSS contributor and is related to GNU.org. I will call him Mr. X. In general, X was friendly. He caught me writing some code in the train and assumed I was writing JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X: Are you writing JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X: Anything that colorful could only be JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ (ummmm... it's the editor]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Are you a programmer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X: I don’t write JavaScript. I am a C hacker. Kernel hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[At this point I did not realize there was a bit mocking tone to his &amp;quot;I don't write JavaScript&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, I didn’t have to ask a lot and a lot of talking was done by Mr. X. Mostly nice talk but a couple of things however, got stuck with me since that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The clique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “He does not write anything that cannot be written with C“. There was a sense of superiority in his style of conversation. “Moi poor web developer”, I thought. I like open-source software and use it everyday. I really wish that this attitude changes amongst the developer community. I really respect your knowledge but it hurts if you lack humility and respect for others, especially the ones who aspire to contribute and support the open-source software and community. This attitude makes it harder for everyone. I am glad that there are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/be-cordial-or-be-on-your-way.html"&gt;posts like this&lt;/a&gt; which support this view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Us Macho Programmers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/macho"&gt;macho&lt;/a&gt; : aggressively virile; a man who is aggressively proud of his masculinity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard the phrase Us macho programmers at least thrice in the conversation. I do not appreciate this. What this conveys to me is that the real programmers are the knights, which in turn, are only masculine. This equates macho with programmers. I have nothing much to say on this issue except that it discouraged me from pursuing being a part of this group he was talking about which I mentioned about in the clique. If I, a male programmer, got discouraged then I can’t imagine what do female programmers feel or think with these kind of phrases being thrown around regularly by people who are leading or are part of the open-source movement. Programming is not a macho profession or something that men control. There maybe more men doing it but I believe that this is the profession’s loss. I am glad that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/2508746"&gt;some people correct themselves&lt;/a&gt; and I hope it happens more often. Another good read is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/girls-go-geek-again/"&gt;this blog on programming as a male profession&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;cite&gt;Fog Creek’s&lt;/cite&gt; blog by Anna Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, I was excited in the beginning to be sitting and chatting and getting to know the insights of the world of core-members and GNU but it was rather disappointing because of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have these men forgotten that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2011/07/the_computer_gi.html"&gt;programming was primarily considered a women’s profession at one point&lt;/a&gt;? Have they forgotten that Ada Lovelace is usually cited as the first programmer? And above all, have they forgotten their decency? I think there wasn’t any decency in these pigs to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if their mothers wanted to be in tech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what women in tech need are more women and more support from the community. Let me rephrase that, what everyone in tech needs today is more women. Also, to boot off anyone who is found guilty of behaving like this.&lt;/p&gt;
